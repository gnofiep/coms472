—— Run in an IDE——
Use IDE like eclipse to run the program or pyrite to run it
or
compile the java files in this folder by using the command:
	javac *.java
to run the CheckersGame class file by using the command:
	java CheckersGame

How to play the game:

In command: <startRow> <startColumn> <endRow> <endColumn>

When you compile and run the program, you will be playing up against the AI. 
It will ask you to enter your move, all you enter are 4 digits of numbers. 
The first two digits are the position of the checker move from
and the later two digits are the position that you want it to move to.

For example: 
Black move: 5 6 4 7 -> 5 6 is the row and column where the checker belongs to, 
and 4 7 is where it will end up. All 4 digits are key in together in a row with each digit separated.
